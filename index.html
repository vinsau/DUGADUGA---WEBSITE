                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born on October 7, 2004. I live in Basak Kagudoy, Lapu-Lapu City. I live with my parents. I also have three older sisters.
                    <br> <br>
                    My family is very close-knit, and we enjoy spending a lot of time together. We are deeply family-oriented.
                    <br> <br>
                    During my childhood, I was quite shy, especially around new people or strangers. However, as I grew and went to high school, I became much more outgoing and approachable.
                    <br> <br>
                    One of the highlights of my high school experience was the amazing friends I made. 
                    Their friendship made my high school years truly memorable. 
                    I pursue college to have a bachelor's degree and to be a successful individual in the future.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I went to school at the age of 4. In kindergarten, I attended Bible Baptist. 
                    <br> <br>
                    For elementary, I went to St. Augustine International School (SAIS) until grade 10. 
                    <br> <br>
                    For senior high school, I studied at Benthel Asia School of Technology Inc. (BAST) from grade 11 to 12. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Currently, I am a college student at Lapu-Lapu City College taking up Bachelor's Science in Industrial Technology.</p>

                <h2>Life</h2>
                <p>For me, life is about the bond we share with our loved ones and the trust we place in each other.
                    <br> <br>
                    It's also about self-acceptance and being comfortable with who we are as individuals. 
                    And once we learn to love ourselves, we can fully appreciate the beauty of life.
                     <br> <br>
                    Ultimately, the most important relationship we have is with God. 
                    We need to fully surrender and trust God in everything we do, 
                    for His plans are greater than ours.</p>

                <p>Listening to music helps me relax and cheers me up, reading comics, 
                    and spending time with my family. We also travel and enjoy doing things together.</p>
